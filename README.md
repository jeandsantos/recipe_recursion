# Recipe Recursion
## Using Object-oriented programming and recursion to process hierarchical formulation data

This repository contains a class to process hierarchical formulation data into a single-level flat formulation.

With its `extract_recipe` method, the `Recipe` class recursively extracts each component's contribution to the overall recipe.
